No one cares.\n\nJust like on the roads, in life too, we see rule-breakers getting ahead, those who follow the right path struggling, and the ones who stop to help others often being the last to move forward.\n\nMaybe it's time we all slowed down a little.\n\nNo matter how fast we run, we\u2019re all going to reach somewhere eventually.

Maybe it\u2019s us.\nMaybe we need to stop chasing, stop flexing, stop pretending.\n\nMaybe the real flex is peace.\n\nMaybe real success is having people who love you.\n\nMaybe true happiness is living for yourself, not for likes.\n\nP.s - The writer in me was dying to come out today and write!!
