Youâ€™re just human. \nYouâ€™re not alone. Youâ€™re just in a new chapter.\n\nAnd itâ€™s okay to pause, breathe, and admitâ€¦ \nThat adulting is hard.\n\nBut weâ€™ll figure it out -\nOne lonely dinner, one new connection, one hopeful day at a time.",

  "text": "Rapido drivers never asked for much.\nJust a way to earn an honest living.\n\nKarnataka High Court asked Rapido and other bike taxi services to suspend operations until proper guidelines are made.\nAnd honestly, itâ€™s heartbreaking.\n\nBecause for us, itâ€™s just news.\n For them, itâ€™s their only source of incomeâ€¦ gone overnight.\n\nYou mustâ€™ve met them -\n The college student riding in between classes to pay his rent.\n The single mom who juggles housework and rides to keep her kids in school.\n The man who left his village and came to the city hoping to earn, riding 12 hours a day just to survive.\n\nMost of them donâ€™t have savings.\nThey don't have backup plans.\nThey have families to feed, bills to pay, and nowâ€¦ no work.\n\nNo oneâ€™s saying rules shouldnâ€™t exist.\nBut can we at least create guidelines without taking away someoneâ€™s rozi-roti?\n\nThese are not just riders.\nTheyâ€™re people trying to do the right thing - earn money without begging, stealing, or depending on anyone.\n\nI hope the government moves fast.\nBecause for many, every day without work is a day without food.",

  "text": "This Generation Got Played - And No One Talks About It\n\nThere was a time when people told us:\nâœ¨ Study hard, get a degree, and youâ€™ll have a stable job.\nâœ¨ Loyalty to a company will reward you.\nâœ¨ If you work hard, life will be easy.\n\nThey lied.\n\nHouses? Too expensive. Even if you earn well, good luck affording one.\n\nSalaries? Not keeping up with inflation. Meanwhile, CEOs get 2000% hikes.\n\nJob security? You could be replaced by AI, automation, or the next â€˜cost-cuttingâ€™ trend.\n\nWork-life balance? A myth. We answer emails at midnight and feel guilty for taking a break.\n\nOlder generations tell us, â€˜You guys donâ€™t work as hard as we did.â€™\n\nBut they didnâ€™t have:\nðŸš© Unpaid internships.\nðŸš© Endless job rejections even with experience.\nðŸš© 14-step interview processes just to be ghosted.\nðŸš© Overqualification being a problem.\nðŸš© Side hustles just to afford basic expenses.\n\nWe were sold a dream that doesnâ€™t exist anymore.\n\nYet, weâ€™re told weâ€™re â€˜too sensitive.â€™ That we just need to â€˜stop complaining and grind harder.â€™\n\nBut how do you grind when:\nðŸ“Œ Rent is half your paycheck?\nðŸ“Œ Therapy is a luxury?\nðŸ“Œ Every passion turns into a side hustle just to survive?\n\nThis generation isnâ€™t â€˜lazy.â€™\nThis generation is exhausted.\n\nWe adapt, we hustle, we fight for mental health, we question toxic work cultures, we learn new skills every year just to stay relevant.\n\nAnd we still get blamed.\n\nItâ€™s not that weâ€™re afraid of hard work.\nItâ€™s just that the world has changed - \nAnd no one prepared us for it.",

  "text": "Every time I try to cross a road nowadays, I get the same feeling -\n\nHow busy people are with their lives, how desperately they want to reach their destination, they'll not care if they'll hit/hurt you in between.\n\nEveryone is overtaking, someone is coming from the wrong side, even when a car stops for me so that I can cross the road, usually there's an activa coming from the backside that'll go before me.\n\nNo one pauses. No one waits. No one cares.\n\nIt's sad man, really sad.\n\nEveryone is so busy, no one cares about the other's safety!\n\nAnd honestly, isnâ€™t this the perfect metaphor for life too?\n\nPeople are always in a rush - chasing deadlines, running behind promotions, hustling for success. And in that race, they barely notice who they push aside, who they inconvenience, or who gets left behind.\n\nNo one pauses. No one waits. No one cares.\n\nJust like on the roads, in life too, we see rule-breakers getting ahead, those who follow the right path struggling, and the ones who stop to help others often being the last to move forward.\n\nMaybe it's time we all slowed down a little.\n\nNo matter how fast we run, weâ€™re all going to reach somewhere eventually. The real question is - will we reach with kindness or will we reach alone?\n\nBecause whatâ€™s the point of reaching your destination if youâ€™ve hurt people along the way?",

  "text": "This generation is not okay.\n\nWe are the most connected generation in history - yet we feel lonelier than ever.\n\nWe have:\n\nFriends in every corner of the world but no one to call when we break down at 2 AM.\n\nThousands of likes on selfies but no one who genuinely likes us for who we are.\n\nA â€˜perfectâ€™ life online but an empty, exhausted soul in reality.\n\nLook around:\n\nPeople are dating just to avoid being alone. Love is no longer about connection - itâ€™s about convenience.\n\nLooks matter more than loyalty. A six-pack gets more respect than a kind heart.\n\nLuxury is being bought on EMI. Weâ€™d rather impress strangers than build real financial stability.\n\nSuccess is about looking successful. People rent expensive cars for Instagram but canâ€™t afford their rent.\n\nFriendships are based on utility. 'What can you do for me?' matters more than genuine care.\n\nBreakups are text messages. Ghosting is normal. Cheating is just a 'mistake.'\n\nMarriage is seen as a burden. People want weddings, not lifelong commitments.\n\nJobs drain us. We work long hours, burn out, and call it 'hustle.'\n\nCheating is normal. People call it a 'mistake' while someoneâ€™s life falls apart.\n\nFake people win. The ones who manipulate, step over others, and lie get ahead.\n\nMental health is a trend. Everyone posts about it, but no one listens when someone truly struggles.\n\nSuccess is about flexing, not achieving. Rent a luxury car, post a reel, fool the world.\n\nKindness is a performance. Show empathy online, be rude in real life.\n\nRelationships are temporary. Love today, cheat tomorrow, move on the next day.\n\nLoyalty is outdated. Who needs commitment when you have options?\n\nIf you're kind, pure, and loyal, this world will use you, break you, and leave you behind.\n\nIf you're too nice, people will take advantage of you.\n\nIf you're too honest, people will call you naÃ¯ve.\n\nIf you're too loyal, people will treat you like an option.\n\nIf you're too genuine, people will think you're weak.\n\nWe chase things we donâ€™t even want - just because the world tells us to.\n\nWe seek validation from people who wouldnâ€™t even show up to our funeral.\n\nWeâ€™re so scared of being left out that we forget what actually matters.\n\nMaybe the problem isnâ€™t society. Maybe itâ€™s us.\nMaybe we need to stop chasing, stop flexing, stop pretending.\n\nMaybe the real flex is peace.\n\nMaybe real success is having people who love you.\n\nMaybe true happiness is living for yourself, not for likes.\n\nP.s - The writer in me was dying to come out today and write!!

Some people sprint, some people jog, and some (like me) take snack breaks every five minutes. The goal is to *not burn out before reaching the finish line.* \n\nSo if you need a break, take it. If you want to rest, do it guilt-free. *Your worth is not measured by how many â€˜grindsetâ€™ reels you watch.* \n\nAnd remember, even your phone needs to recharge. So why shouldnâ€™t you?\n\nP.s - If you read till here, I am just curious about why you follow me, like what exactly do you like about my posts?

Start running and you'll be confused - which is worse? my mental health or my physical health?\n\nYou'll stop overthinking. Because instead of lying awake at night questioning your life choices, you'll be passed out by 10 PM thinking â€” Was that my last set or did I black out?\n\nAnd forget office politics â€” once you hit leg day properly, the only thing you'll be thinking is, 'How do I climb these 3 stairs without crying?'\n\nThe next time someone dumps extra work on you at 6 PM, you won't get angry - you'll smile and think, 'I'll use this frustration to hit a new PR tomorrow.'\n\nCardio will teach you lifeâ€™s biggest lesson - no matter how fast you run, you canâ€™t escape your problemsâ€¦ or your boss's 7 AM meeting invite.",
